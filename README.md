# Interactive Celestial Mechanics Simulator

An interactive desktop application simulating planetary orbital mechanics, built for the British Physics Olympiad Computational Challenge 2023. Awarded Gold 🏆.

All orbital mechanics are computed analytically using the polar equation of an ellipse, with no physics engine or third-party simulation library. The app was packaged with PyInstaller into a standalone .exe so it runs on any Windows machine without a Python installation.

## Features

Seven competition tasks are accessible from a central menu:

| # | Task | Highlights |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Kepler's Third Law** | Kepler's Third Law — T vs a³/² for all planets |
| 2 | **Static 2D Orbits** | Static 2D elliptical orbits (inner & outer solar system) |
| 3 | **Animated 2D Orbits** | Animated 2D orbits with Start / Stop / Resume / Reset |
| 4 | **Animated 3D Orbits** | Animated 3D orbits with true orbital inclinations |
| 5 | **Orbital Angle vs Time** | Numerically integrates Kepler's Second Law via Simpson's Rule, inverted with a cubic spline; interactive eccentricity slider |
| 6 | **Spirograph Patterns** | Connecting lines between any two planets over user-defined orbits, producing synodic patterns |
| 7 | **Relative Orbits** | Re-centres the solar system on any chosen planet; available in both 2D and 3D |

## Technical Overview

All orbital positions are derived analytically from the polar equation of an ellipse with the Sun at the focus:

```
r(θ) = a(1 − e²) / (1 − e·cos θ)
```

3D coordinates apply each planet's true orbital inclination *i*:

```
x = r·cos(θ)·cos(i),   y = r·sin(θ),   z = r·cos(θ)·sin(i)
```

Each task lives in its own module with a Matplotlib canvas class (subclassing Matplotlib's `FigureCanvasQTAgg`). Where a task comes in inner/outer or 2D/3D variants, those variants share a small per-task base class holding the common dark-theme styling and animation lifecycle, so each variant only defines its own set of planets. All the planet data (semi-major axis, period, eccentricity, inclination) lives in a single `planets.py`.

**Stack:** Python · PyQt5 · Matplotlib · NumPy · SciPy · PyInstaller
