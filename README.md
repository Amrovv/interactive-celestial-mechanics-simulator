# Interactive Celestial Mechanics Simulator

An interactive desktop application simulating planetary orbital mechanics, built for the British Physics Olympiad Computational Challenge 2023. Awarded Gold 🏆.

All orbital mechanics are computed analytically using the polar equation of an ellipse, with no physics engine or third-party simulation library. The app was packaged with PyInstaller into a standalone .exe so it runs on any Windows machine without a Python installation.

## Features

Seven competition tasks are accessible from a central menu:

| # | Task | Highlights |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Kepler's Third Law** | Plots T vs a³/² for all nine planets, confirming the linear relationship |
| 2 | **Static 2D Orbits** | Elliptical orbits rendered from the polar ellipse equation, Sun at the focus |
| 3 | **Animated 2D Orbits** | Real-time animation with Start / Stop / Resume / Reset controls |
| 4 | **Animated 3D Orbits** | Extends Task 3 with true planetary inclinations and a speed modifier for outer planets |
| 5 | **Orbital Angle vs Time** | Numerically integrates Kepler's Second Law via Simpson's Rule, inverted with a cubic spline; interactive eccentricity slider |
| 6 | **Spirograph Patterns** | Connecting lines between any two planets over user-defined orbits, producing synodic Lissajous patterns |
| 7 | **Relative Orbits** | Re-centres the solar system on any chosen planet; available in both 2D and 3D |

## Technical Overview

All orbital positions are derived analytically from the polar equation of an ellipse with the Sun at the focus:

```
r(θ) = a(1 − e²) / (1 − e·cos θ)
```

3D coordinates apply each planet's true orbital inclination *i*:

```
x = r·cos(θ)·cos(i),   y = r·sin(θ),   z = r·cos(θ)·sin(i)
```

The codebase uses OOP inheritance throughout — each task's canvas inherits from a shared base class (`FigureCanvasQTAgg`) that handles dark-theme styling, axis setup, and animation lifecycle, keeping task-specific code focused purely on physics logic.

**Stack:** Python · PyQt5 · Matplotlib · NumPy · SciPy · PyInstaller
